Simple git hooks

## Installation

```
npm install ghooks --save-dev
```

_It is not advised to install `ghooks` as a production dependency, as it will install git hooks in your production environment as well. Please install it under the `devDependencies` section of your `package.json`._

_Please also note, that it is absolutely **not advised** to install `ghooks` globally. To work as expected, make it a development dependency of your project(s)._

## Setup

Add a `config.ghooks` entry in your `package.json` and simply specify which git hooks you want and their corresponding commands, like the following:

```
{
  …
  "config": {
    "ghooks": {
      "pre-commit": "gulp lint",
      "commit-msg": "validate-commit-msg",
      "pre-push": "make test",
      "post-merge": "npm install",
      "post-rewrite": "npm install",
      …
    }
  }
  …
}
```

**Note:** _The hooks' working directory is relative to the git root (where you have your `.git` directory). This means that if your package.json is in a subdirectory of your git repo, you'll need to cd into the directory before running any npm scripts. E.g.:_

```json
"pre-commit": "cd path/to/folder && npm run test"
```

## opt-in/out

One of the last things you want is to raise the barrier to contributing to your open source project. So [Andreas Windt](https://github.com/ta2edchimp) developed the [opt-cli](https://npmjs.com/package/opt-cli) package to allow you to turn your hooks into opt-in/out scripts. See this project's [`package.json`](package.json) for an example of how to do that.

## All [documented](http://git-scm.com/docs/githooks) hooks are available:

* applypatch-msg
* pre-applypatch
* post-applypatch
* pre-commit

* pre-receive
* update
* post-receive
* post-update
